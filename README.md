Fireworks
=========

Fireworks in OpenGL (university assignment)

There's currently two kinds of particles:
- **Spark** particles, which briefly flash and fade out, and
- **Spawners**, which launch into the air and explode, causing sparks to appear a couple of times.

Controls
--------

A number of spawners are launched automatically, but the following controls can be used to manually launch spawners or clear the screen.

- <kbd>Space</kbd> launches a single spawner;
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> launches multiple spawners at the same time;
- <kbd>F5</kbd> and <kbd>R</kbd> removes all particles, clearing the screen.
